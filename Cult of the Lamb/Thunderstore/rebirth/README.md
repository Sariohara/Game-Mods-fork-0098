# Rebirth

* Followers can be reborn, allowing you to change their names, looks etc.
* First one is free; subsequent ones on the same follower require 25 Rebirth Tokens obtained from crusading. 
* * Source of the tokens is from killing enemies, destroying old bone piles (not the ones from enemies), dungeon chests and offering shrines and more.
* * The drop chance starts at 15% and scales with your dungeon luck modifier. 
* The followers' XP carries over, but there is a 10% chance they lose half of their XP and 1 level when reborn. There is a notification when this happens.
* Their old body stays; compost it, eat it. Up to you.
* Refine the tokens at your refineries for 15 bones!
* Send your followers on a mission to get tokens!
* Go on a quest yourself to get tokens!

## Recommendation

While not a hard requirement, I recommend you install [Unity Debugger Assistant](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/LethalCompanyModding/UnityDebuggerAssistant/) which allows for better log files when an exception happens because of a mod, which means I have more information to work with when bug reports are posted.

## Installation

* Install [BepInExPack CultOfTheLamb](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_CultOfTheLamb/)
* Install [COLT API](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/xhayper/COTL_API/)
* Install [Configuration Manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/p1xel8ted/BepInEx_Configuration_Manager/)
* Place the plugin DLLs into your "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\plugins" folder. Either run the game, or create it if it doesn't exist.

## Configuration

* The configuration file is generated when you first run the game with the mod enabled. It can be found in the "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\config" folder.
* Press F1 in game to open the configuration manager. If you're in a dungeon, pause the game first otherwise the cursor doesn't work.

## Issues

* Please use the Bug tab on the page over at [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cultofthelamb/mods/8?tab=bugs).
